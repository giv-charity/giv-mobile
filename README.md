## Inspiration
#### sharity is inspired by market need...

>"Millennials are most likely to... **donate via mobile and watch online videos before making a gift...**
>Only **11%** of total US giving comes from **Millennials**, even 
>though they make up **25.9%** of the US population!"
([nonprofitssource.com](https://nonprofitssource.com/))

>As older donors age, it is increasingly important for NPOs to 
>encourage support in the way which younger donors understand.
>NPOs and NGOs have difficulty fighting noise to reach a young donor audience. 
>As a result, communication between orgs and their young donors feels in-authentic or forced.



## What it does
#### sharity is...

- a **giving platform inspiring donors with short-form video.**
- a curated list of vetted orgs and their best short-form video promotion.
- a personal portfolio of a user's favorite charities.
- a native application on iOS and Android.


## How we built it
#### sharity is built with love, redbull and... 
- React Native: for the native UI on iOS and Android
- GraphQL: for querying and mutating user and organization data.
- Google Cloud: for hosting user and organization data.


## Challenges we ran into
1. It was our first time building a full-stack react-native project, 
which proved a difficult obstacle. 
2. Communication between our database and application layers took a great deal of time and effort.
3. React Native is a highly powerful tool, but the wide variety of 
packages and components caused a fair amount of conflict and delay in the progress of our development.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We're incredibly proud of having built something that will provide **real value to the world and organizations** that we show this hack to!
- sharity is a proof of concept that will be used to gain valuable feedback and continue development!


## What we learned
- We learned fullstack **React Native** app development on this project.
- We used **Google Cloud** databases for the first time on this project.
- Responsive views, database management, querying, login authentication, video streaming, and react-native carousel drawer-menu management were all challenging steps in our development.


## What's next for sharity
#### sharity will...
- be showcased, developed, and hopefully funded in the **[2019 UCI New Venture competition](https://merage.uci.edu/research-faculty/centers/innovation-entrepreneurship/new-venture-competiton.html)**.
- be **demoed to many donors and orgs** to gain valuable feedback on how to help their causes.
- be made into something **donors enjoy and organizations need.**
